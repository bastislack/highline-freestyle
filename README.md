## Development

we don't always know what we really do, but we try to keep some order, through issues ...

### requirements:

- node
- npm

### setup

1. install node modules

   Open a terminal and in the root folder (highline-freestyle) run `npm install`

2. start the development server

   run `npm run dev`
 
3. run the production environment (needed to use features of the service worker -> offline usage)

   run `npm run serve`

sometimes after updating you have to delete your indexDB in your browser, through the development tools (__Storage__ in firefox, __Application__ in chrome)

### project structure

right now we are just working on the main branch, until we get to have a halfway working beta version (our first milestone)

after that we will develop on a separate branch and keep the main branch always working
