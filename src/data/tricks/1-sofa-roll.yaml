description: Sit in Sofa, grab the line with both hands and press the line
  against your butt/thighs. Then throw yourself forward or backward, initiating
  the roll. To stop the roll, extend your legs.
tips:
  - Leash to the side can help prevent bad falls
  - If you fall into a backlever position let go of the line in order to save
    your shoulders
  - You can practice this trick with a hangover clipped in to save energy and
    get familiar with the movement without fear of falling badly
